## CUT&Tag Data Visualization

This is an R Markdown document. Here, we utilize SAM and Bed files to visualize fragment length and distribution, peak count, signal distribution, and peak annotation characteristics.

This workflow can work for CUT&Tag data as long as there are available .bam and .bed files. \*note: the .bam file was used to create the .sam files using galaxy.

> First, we will utilize the Henikoff Protocol to visualize the fragment length distribution. We will use the .sam file generated. The 9th column was already extracted and stored into a separate file using Command Line.

```{r Fragment Dist, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)

sampleList = c("Day0","Day0h","Day1","Day2","Day3","Day4","Day5","Day7","Day10",
                   "Day15","Day30","IgG")
CUTTag_Colors <- c("#883268","#3E7274","#94C470","#C03830","#883268","#3E7274","#94C470","#C03830","#883268","#3E7274","#94C470" ,"#000000")
histList = c("H3K27ac")


fragLen = c()
for(hist in sampleList){
        histInfo = histList
        fragLen = read.table(choose.files(), header = FALSE) %>% 
                mutate(fragLen = V1 %>% as.numeric, 
                       fragCount = V2 %>% as.numeric, 
                       Weight = as.numeric(V2)/sum(as.numeric(V2)), 
                       Histone = histInfo[1], sampleInfo = hist) %>% rbind(fragLen, .) 
}

fragLen$sampleInfo = factor(fragLen$sampleInfo, levels = sampleList)
fragLen$Histone = factor(fragLen$Histone, levels = histList)
```

## Violin and Fragment Length Histogram Distributions

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Violin Plot, echo=FALSE}
#fragViolinPlot <- 
        fragLen %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = sampleInfo, y = fragLen, weight = Weight, fill = sampleInfo)) +
        geom_violin(bw = 5, alpha = 0.8) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 800, 50)) +
        scale_fill_manual(values = CUTTag_Colors) +  # Use scale_fill_manual with your custom colors
        theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 800)) +
        ylab("Fragment Length") +
        xlab("")

#fragViolinPlot

#fragHistDist <- 
        fragLen %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = fragLen, y = fragCount, color = sampleInfo, group = sampleInfo, linetype = Histone)) +
        geom_line(size = 1) +
        scale_color_manual(values = CUTTag_Colors) +  # Use scale_color_manual for line colors
        scale_linetype_manual(values = c("solid", "dashed")) +  # Use scale_linetype_manual for line types
        theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
        xlab("Fragment Length") +
        ylab("Count") +
        coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 500), ylim = c(0, 45000))

#fragHistDist

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
